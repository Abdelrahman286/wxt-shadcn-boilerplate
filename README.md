This is a boilerplate for building Chrome extensions using React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN.

## Features

   cd chrome-extension-boilerplate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```sh

   ```
4. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open **chrome://extensions/** in your browser.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right corner).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder.

## Adding ShadCN Components

ShadCN components are **not** included by default. To use them:

1. Visit [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
2. Copy the desired component's code manually into your project.
3. Ensure required dependencies are installed as per ShadCN's documentation.

## Development

```

This will watch for changes and rebuild automatically.
